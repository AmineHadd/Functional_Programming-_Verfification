# Functional_Programming_And_Verfification (Ocaml)

This module contains the key concepts of functional programming languages. After Completing this course i have the ability to well solve presented tasks in a functional programming language. I became also familiar with the most important techniques for the verification of imperative and functional programming language and can apply them to simple programs.

Skills acquired :

- Correctness of imperative programs

++ Verification according to Floyd or Hoare

++ Termination

++ Procedures


  
- Basic concepts of functional programming

++ Values, variables, functions

++ Data_structures, pattern matching

++ Higher order functions

++ Polymorphic types

++ Programming in the large: Structures and Functors

++ Correctness of functional programs

+++ Semantics of functional programs

+++ Verification of functional programs
